=======

A hexdump implementation.

With the difference of, there is no input file, it generates random bytes and allows you to embed custom text into it.

The display format starts with the offset in hexadecimal, followed by 16 space-separated random hexadecimal bytes that contains your custom text and finally followed by the same sixteen bytes in ASCII representation.
